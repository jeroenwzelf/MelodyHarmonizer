This repository has been created to perform experiments for my bachelor thesis, "Realtime Melody Harmonization in an Improvisational Context".
The bachelor thesis was a mandatory project for getting a bachelor in Computer Science of [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/).

This project is hosted and can be viewed on https://bachelorproject.jeroenwzelf.nl/.
